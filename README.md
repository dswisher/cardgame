# Card Game #

A multi-player card game.

## Initial Setup ##

This was written using python 3.6.5. Here are the steps I used:

1) In the root directory, run: `pyenv local 3.6.5`
2) Set up the virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3) Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`
4) Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note that you will need to activate the venv for each new shell!
