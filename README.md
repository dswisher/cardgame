# Card Game #

A multi-player card game.

## Initial Setup ##

This was written using python 3.6.6. Here are the steps I used:

1) In the root directory, run: `pyenv local 3.6.6`
2) Set up the virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3) Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`
4) Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note that you will need to activate the venv for each new shell!

## Managing Requirements ##

There are a couple of python tools that I use for development, but I do not want those to be part of
the `requirements.txt` file. In addition, there are only a handful of direct dependencies, and I wish
to keep those separate from the transitive closure.

For that to happen, I use two files: `requirements-to-freeze.txt`, which contains the direct dependencies,
without any versions. This allows upgrading requirements by executing:

    pip install -r requirements-to-freeze.txt --upgrade

The dev tools and their dependencies are kept in the second file, `requirements-to-ignore.txt`. Keeping
these separate allows regeneration of the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

    pip freeze -r requirements-to-freeze.txt | grep -vFxf requirements-to-ignore.txt > requirements.txt

The `requirements-to-ignore.txt` file was generated by installing all the dev dependencies first,
then running `pip freeze > requirements-to-ignore.txt`, then manually removing some of the cross-dependencies.

This is all based on the [better pip workflow](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/a-better-pip-workflow) blog entry, plus this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43137206/282725).

## Common Tasks ##

To run, do:

1) `export FLASK_APP=cardgame.py`
2) `flask run`
